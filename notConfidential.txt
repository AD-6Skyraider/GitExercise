DC was going to have a more awesomener movie than Avengers and it was going to be called "MAustin." But their legal dept said they couldn't be more gooder than the Dynamic Duo they already had. Because then they would have to be called the "Meh, Sorta-Dynamic Duo" and that doesn't look good on comic book pages. 
Test audiences for MAustin upon screening for "The Adventures of MAustin" suffered hysteria, bone loss, bone growth, explosive diarrhea, blindness in one eye, confusion, and short term memory loss. 
Scientists were able to relate this to SuperAwesomenessMostGooder syndrome. First witnessed in 1974 when His Holy Awesomeness, The Don, was born and set free unto the world. 
After he retired, the world needed a new hero. NAY!! The world needed TWO new heroes! They needed... MAustin!!!
And that, Charlie Brown, is why DC has crappy movies. They can never reach that of the awesome Maustin.
